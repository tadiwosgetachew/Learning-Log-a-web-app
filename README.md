# Learning Log

Welcome to **Learning Log**! This is a simple Django-based web application where learners can record and track what theyâ€™ve learned. Whether you're learning programming, languages, or any other subject, this app allows you to jot down notes and keep track of your progress.

## Features
- **Log entries**: Create, read, update, and delete notes on what you've learned.
- **Categorized notes**: Organize entries by topics for easy reference.
- **User authentication**: Sign up and log in to access and manage your learning logs.
- **Responsive design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation

To run the Learning Log project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3**: Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tadiwosgetachew/Learning-Log-a-web-app.git
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

```bash
# For Mac/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows:
python -m venv venv
ll_env\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set Up the Database

Run the following command to set up the database (SQLite by default):

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 5: Create a Superuser (Optional)

To access the Django admin interface, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create an admin account.

### Step 6: Run the Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Once the server is running, you can open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to use the app locally.

## Usage

### Accessing the App

- After running the development server, you can visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to start using the Learning Log app.
- Sign up for an account, or log in if you already have one.
- Create and manage your learning logs, categorize them by topics, and view all your previous entries.

### Admin Interface

- To access the Django admin interface, go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin).
- Use the superuser account created earlier to log in and manage users, logs, and categories.

## Development

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository if you haven't done so already:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tadiwosgetachew/Learning-Log-a-web-app.git
```

### Installing Dependencies

Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure the `.env` File

In the project root (same level as `manage.py`), create a file called `.env` and open it in a text editor. Add the following settings to the file:

```env
# Secret key for cryptographic signing
SECRET_KEY=your-generated-secret-key  # You can generate one at the Django Secret Key Generator (https://djecrety.ir/)

# Set to 'True' for development, 'False' for production
DEBUG=True

# Database URL for local development (SQLite is fine for testing)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3 
```

### Running the Development Server

To run the app locally and test your changes, run:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Running Tests

You can run Django's built-in tests to make sure everything is working as expected:

```bash
python manage.py test
```
